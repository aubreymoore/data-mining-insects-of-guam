Brachyplatys pacificus Dallas.</p> <p>Brachyplatys pacifica Dallas, List Hemipt. Brit. Mus. 1: 70, 1851.</p> <p>One specimen each collected by Fullaway, 1911, and Hornbostel, August 1923. Five specimens, Usinger, and three specimens, Swezey, Ritidian Point, at the end of the road, June 30. These were found on a wide variety of plants, but eggs were discovered on only two kinds of plants, one of which was Pipturus. The eggs were found in batches of nine eggs each, arranged alternately in two parallel rows. They are creamy white with the chorion finely punctate, approximately 1 mm. in length and 0.50.mm. wide. The micropylar end is circular and subflattened with its surface feebly convex. A distinct, pale carina surrounds this apical plate. Along the middle of the egg is a broad, elevated ridge which is laterally impunctate and medially depressed and punctate. Upon hatching, the micropylar end opens as a hinged lid, the hinge being at the longitudinal ridge. A T-shaped egg burster is present. As development proceeds, red eye spots appear as is usual with hemipterous eggs. One batch of eggs collected at Ritidian Point, June 30, was parasitized by Ooencyrtus pacificus Waterston, as determined by D. T. Fullaway. Fourteen more specimens were taken by Swezey at Ritidian Point on August 6, 1936, one at Orote Point, Sept. 27, one at Dandan, July 17, one at Machanao, June 4, and one on Ipomoea on Mt. Alifan, June 19. I collected one on Mt. Alifan, May 26 and two on morning-glory at Machanao, June 4, 1936.</p> <p>This species had previously been reported from the Marianas Islands (Distant, Nova Caled., Zool. 1: 370, 1914).</p></div> 	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F5043F644B58EAB6FB84C332	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

Alifan, June 27, Usinger; Barrigada, July 22, clustered by the hundreds on Morinda leaves, Swezey; one specimen, Guam, Sept. 28, 1938, on Colubrina asiatica, Oakley. A single, apparently perfectly typical male is at hand from Palau Islands, Ngeremlengui, Galmiskan, April 23, 1936, Z. Ono. At Ritidian Point, eggs, nymphs of all stages, and adults were common. They were also seen in large numbers at Machanao on June 5. The nymphs ran about on the ground and on dead leaves and were often seen feeding on dead nymphs and adults of their own species.</p> <p>This species runs to L. abdominalis in Sta.l's key (Enum. Hemipt. 3: 99, 1873) but differs from descriptions of that species in its smaller size (16 to 20 mm. in abdominalis) and its red abdomen (black in abdominalis). A more detailed comparison is impossible in the absence of authentically determined specimens but taprobanensis (Dallas), which Distant in 1902 placed as a variety of abdominalis, has very slender genital arms which are strongly convergent posteriorly. L. ahnnei (Cheesman) and related Polynesian species have much broader genital arms which are posteriorly strongly divergent. The Philippine rufomarginatus (Fabricius), although much larger, differently colored and with an entircly different pronotum, has genitalia somewhat similar to the Micronesian species. The arms are broader, however, and longer and slightly divergent and the median claspers are relatively short, scarcely exceeding level of apices of arms. I have a single female from Luzon which resembles the Guam species very closely in structure but the head and pronotum are clothed with much longer, erect, black bristles, the pronotum is narrower behind and the clavus and corium are almost entirely infuscated. This last may be augur (Fabricius) whose lateral pronotal margins are described by Distant (Fauna Brit. India, Rhynch. 1:420, 1902) as "moderately hirsute." A female of insularis Kirkaldy from Fiji differs in its uniformly darker coloration and longer rostrum.</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F5023F7D4B58EAC1FDD2C39A	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

Lundblad for the loan of a cotype of pulchellus from the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseum, Stockholm.</p> <p>Nysius pulchellus occurs most commonly on Euphorbia hirta, Portulaca, Pemphis, and Vernonia. Eggs are laid rather loosely in composite heads and may be obtained from captive bugs in cotton-stoppered vials, the eggs being inserted into the cotton plugs. After two days, red eye spots appear, becoming more distinct as development progresses. The eggs hatch in seven days. The first-instar nymphs are decidedly reddish in appearance. They molt in three days, becoming considerably more robust and ferrugineous in color with longitudinal stripes on the head and mottled pale testaceous areas over the dorsum. The second instar lasts five days and the three succeeding nymphal instars each last three days. The total period of development from egg to adult is 24 days.</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F51C3F7C4B47E935F8A4C3B9	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

They are close to pacificus China but have a slightly shorter and less dense pubescence dorsally, particularly on the hemelytra. The presence of pacificus on Tutuila, alone of the Samoan Islands, is not particularly remarkable since it was probably introduced there. I also have specimens from Fiji and Amboina. Specimens are at hand from India determined as ceylanicus Motschulsky by Distant. These also belong with pacificus while a paratype of turneri Evans from Tasmania is closely allied but has longer, erect pubescence, especially on the pronotum. These closely related species form a group which is widely distributed throughout the Austro-Oriental region. Representatives of this group are also at hand from south and central China and from Japan. The status of the various Oriental species of Nysius can only be determined by a thorough systematic revision based upon a study of type specimens.</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F51D3F7C4BADED9BF92CC799	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

Series from other islands, especially at the extremes of the range such as Rapa, suggest a Rassenkreis but the Guam series does not seem to be sufficiently extreme to warrant a special name at this time.</p> <p>P. nigriceps was commonest on heliotrope on which eggs were laid on June 23. The eggs were deposited at the tip of a flower head amongthe small flowers. They were placed crosswise to one another and rather loosely in the open but were fastened together and to the flower calyx. They are elongate, slightly curved, about 1 mm. long by 0.35 mm. in diameter. The micropylar end is thicker, subtruncate, while the other end is tapering and rounded at the tip. The chorion is sculptured, exhibiting prominent hexagonal reticulations on the anterior (micropylar) third. Near the middle, these become inconspicuous or appear as slight rugosities. The posterior end is perfectly smooth. The whole surface is glabrous and the egg is almost water white in color. There are five small but very distinct processes forming a small ring on the surface of the micropylar end. The incubation period is six days.</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F51F3F7E4BBCEC38FA82C877	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply. See Agosti, D., Egloff, W., 2009.

It differs from dilaticeps in that the spines on the lateral margins of the pronotum are shorter, the scutellum is longer and feebly widened beyond apical third, and the median carina of the scutellum is more distinct.</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F5163F714B53E877FA8AC4E4	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

The hemelytra are dark brown with pale across their entire bases including clavus and corium and the hind lobe of the head is quite pale. Four female specimens from Manila, collected by C. S.

The hemelytra are only about four times as long as greatest width in that species, and the fuscous markings of the hemelytra are more extensive. From the present material I am not able to judge whether this is an unwarranted extension of the generic concept of Ademula or not. I collected a new species which is very close to this at Los Banos, Luzon, but this species has much longer hairs on the legs and on the first antennal segment, the mesonotal spine is longer, the black subapical annulations are strikingly narrow on the first antennal segment and on the middle and hind femora, and the posterior process of the male genital capsule is narrower at base and broader and rounded apically.</p> <p>Both of these species will run directly to Empicoris in McAtee and Malloch's key but they obviously have nothing to do with this genus, the venation, in particular, referring them directly to Ademula. Kirkaldy's Fijian calamine is related to distincta but has shorter hairs on the first antennal segment, has a smoother pronotum with long, fine hairs anteriorly and laterally, and is shorter and broader with differently colored hemelytra.</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F52C3F4F4B4DE7D8FB7AC305	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

When freshly laid, the eggs are white and are covered with a somewhat longitudinally striated, transparent layer of mucus which is drawn out at the micropylar end. The egg is 0.75 mm. long and 0.4 mm. at its greatest width. It is oblong-oval, broadly rounded on one side and scarcely rounded on the other, rounded posteriorly, and with micropylar end carinate around a relatively small cap, the diameter across cap half that of greatest diameter of egg. The chorion is very smooth, polished, without spines and processes, and the egg thus resembles eggs of Reduvius and Triatoma rather than those of Emesinae. Incubation period of eggs, eight days.</p> <p>P. marianensis is very close to the Philippine fuscovittatus Stal in size and coloration but the pronotal spines in that species, according to Distant (Fauna Brit. India, Rhynch. 2: 219, 1904), are "about as long as pronotum.'' A more detailed comparison is impossible because of the inadequate descriptions of the Philippine species. P. similis China from Samoa is much larger with relatively longer second antenna! segment, more acute and upright metanotal spine, and convex sides of female genital plate. A male from Houailou, New Caledonia, agrees with marianensis in size and in genital characters but the pronotal spines are much smaller, only one seventh as long as width of pronotum across humeri, and the color is quite different, the head, pronotum, and legs being tinged with red. The male genitalia resemble those of selangorensis Miller but that species is smaller with relatively longer pronotal spines.</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F5293F4B4BD9EE0AFB77C97B	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

This last has been reported from Samoa [Knight, Ins. Samoa 2(5): 228, 1935] but the identification must be regarded as provisional because no authentic material w,;1. savailable for comparison and the antennal proportions were noted as different. Such identifications based upon degree of correspondence to an inadequate description are of little value in this group. Reuter and Poppius evidently failed to note the striking differences existing in the form of male genital claspers in Lasiochilus. Furthermore, they considered denigratus (White) to be a single variable species with decolor as a variety. Kirkaldy (Haw. Ent. Soc., Proc. 1: 196-197, 1908) showed that each of the main Hawaiian islands has a distinct species of Lasiochilus. Distant (Linn. Soc. London, Trans. 16: 184-186, 1913) found an amazing number of endemics in the Seychelles and a large number of endemics may be expected among the numerous islands of Polynesia and Micronesia. Denigratus and other Hawaiian species differ from marianensis, swezeyi, and the undescribed species before me from Fiji in the large, inwardly bent apical lobe of the male genital clasper.</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F5253F464BD1E655FC3CC294	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

Disk deeply, broadly depressed behind callosities and then subflattened to posterior margin. Rather uniformly clothed with curved, backwardly directed hairs with similar dense hairs along lateral margins and a long, erect hair on either side at antero-lateral angle.

My Oriental specimens from Guam, the Philippines, and Macao differ from California specimens as follows: the body is usually tinged with pink on the antennae and less conspicuously on the head, pronotum, coria, and apices of legs; the first antennal segment is shorter than width of head across eyes, 9: 12; the second antennal segment is but little longer than third, 26: 23; the first segment of hind tarsi is distinctly longer than the second and third together; and the rostrum usually reaches almost to apices of middle coxae.

Acad. Sci., Proc. 4(22): 115, 1937] are entirely confused. After studying his material, it is evident that the Solomon Island specimens are straniineus, though the first antenna! segment is even longer than in specimens from other localities. One specimen from Pitcairn and one from Mangareva agree with stramineus while the remaining material, including one specimen from Pitcairn and all of the specimens from the Australs and the Marquesas, belongs to samoanus Knight. Both samoanus and stramineus are now known to occur on Tutuila and Upolu in Samoa, on Tubuai in the Australs and on Pitcairn. The much larger insularis Poppius from New Caledonia is quite distinct. The Tahitian pacificus Stal may not even belong to the Pacific island fauna, because many of the localities recorded on the Eugenies Resa expedition were erroneous (Kirkaldy, Soc. ent. Belg., Ann. 51: 120-122, 1907).</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F53F3F5E4BDEEE0FFA96C6D1	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply. See Agosti, D., Egloff, W., 2009.

Swezey and Zimmerman took specimens of tenuis in Samoa.</p> <p>Few species of insects are in a more confused state both taxonomically and nomenclatorially than the dicyphine pests of tobacco and tomato. Their small size and superficial similarity have contributed to this but do not excuse the situation, for the male terminalia exhibit striking differences which are specifically distinct and point the way to a sound generic classification. The literature on the subject was summarized by China (Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. XI, 1: 604- 607, 1938) although Kirkaldy's description of Cyrtopeltis (?) nicotianae (Linn. Soc. N. S. Wales, Proc. 33: 377, 1908), Froggatt's description of Dicyphus tabaci (Agric. Gaz. N. S. Wales 31: 715, 1920), and Knight's discussion of the genus Cyrtopeltis (Brooklyn Ent. Soc., Bull. 17:65-67, 1922) were omitted.</p> <p>China concluded that nicotianae Koningsberger, crassicornis Distant, javanus Poppius, and nocivus Fulmek were all synonyms of tenuis Reuter, stating that Fulmek's figures of the left genital claspers of different species (Deli Proefstation, Bull. 25: 4, 1925) were not of the same organ but of different parts of the same insect. To quote China further, "Judging by the shape of the Haftzange in nicotianae it appears to be a broken portion of the inferior lateral margin of the pygophor (ninth abdominal segment) viewed from the left side of the pygophor but with the drawing actually reversed."</p> <p>In the case of nocivus he figured the actual paramere, calling it again the "Zinke Haftzange." Careful comparison of Fulmek's figures with the two species which I found on tobacco on Guam reveals that Fulmek was correct, his drawings actually being of homologous structures of two distinct species. The left clasper of nicotianae is truly an amazing structure and corresponds, except for minor details in structure of the apex of the broad lobe, with my Guam specimens. The last abdominal segment also differs strikingly in the two species, nicotianae having a bifurcate posterior process suggestive of the American tobacco bug, Engytatus geniculatus Reuter (fig. 19, a, b), whereas tenuis (= nocivus Fulmek) has a simple main posterior process (see China's excellent figure of a cotype).</p> <p>The generic classification of the Dicyphinae has long been confused so that Reuter, Poppius, and Horvath as well as other, lesser, authorities changed species from one genus to another with no apparent reason, only to change them back again. Knight has lumped many of these into the genus Cyrtopeltis, a practice which is at least consistent though making it almost impossible to use his keys to the genera. In this work I have concluded that the male terminalia provide us with the only sound basis for a generic classification of the Dicyphinae. Reluctance to base a higher classification upon characters of one sex is understandable but this practice has been found necessary in other groups (scale insects and Lepidoptera) and seems justifiable in the Dicyphinae considering the hopeless confusion that has resulted from attempts to classify these bugs on the basis of such superficialities as size of eyes or color of head and pronotum.</p> <p>The following characters will suffice to distinguish the questionable Dicyphine genera in so far as my material is concerned. Modifications will undoubtedly be necessary when further material is examined. I have not seen the types of Dicyphus and Macrolophus.</p> <p>Dicyphus Fieber (type pallidus Herrich Schaeffer). Left genital clasper thickened at base, bent at middle, and tapering to acute apex. Last abdominal segment not produced into long spines, knobs, or processes. Pronotum more or less constricted at middle and eyes relatively large.</p> <p>Macrolophus Fieber (type nubilus Fieber). Left genital clasper thickened at base, bent near middle, and flattened into a broad but apically tapering blade. Last abdominal segment not produced into long spines, knobs or processes. Eyes relatively small.</p> <p>Cyrtopeltis Fieber (type geniculata Fieber). Left genital clasper as in Macrolophus. Last abdominal segment roundly produced as a short, broad, upturned lobe posteriorly and with a prominent rounded knob on the left side of the segment. Eyes relatively large. This is apparently monotypic.</p> <p>Engytatus Reuter (type geniculatus Reuter). Left genital clasper as in Macrolophus or with the thickened basal portion much enlarged and extending beyond the point of origin of the bladelike arm (as in nicotianae). Last abdominal segment more or less strongly produced ventrally into an upturned process which branches into two arms apically. Eyes variable in size. Confusa Perkins and hawaiiensis Kirkaldy belong here. Geniculatus Reuter was a secondary homonym in Cyrtopeltis, where Reuter and Knight placed it. Hepce the name of the next oldest synonym, varians Distant, was used. According to the Banks and Caudell Code and the recommendations of the British Commission on Entomological Nomenclature, the name geniculatus may now be restored but the International Code is not so clear on this point.</p> <p>Gallobelieus Distant (type crassicornis Distant = tenuis Reuter). Left genital clasper abruptly elbowed and typically with the apical arm very long and tapering. Last abdominal segment produced ventrally into a more or less prominent, unbranched arm and with a second projection near base of clasper at least in the type species. I have collected another species of this genus on Luzon, and Knight's Marquesan species (B. P. Bishop Mus., Bull. 142: 173- 177, 1938) may belong here.</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F5323F2D4B42ECEDFCC6C85A	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

Poppius also mentions the distinct apical stricture of the pronotum. The arolia are of course not visible in Distant's figure and are not mentioned in his description but there is certainly no trace of a collar in Distant's genus. As mentioned above, fragilis has a very small collar, visible only under highest magnification (108 diameters). The arolia are free and convergentapicallyasintypicalOrthotylinae. IreferthisspeciestoZanchiusbecause it agrees so perfectly with Distant's description and figure, differing only in the more slender body form and in the absence of a "cell-like process at apex of corium", though the costal margin widens near the apex. I have seen species of Zanchius from Samoa and Fiji.</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F54D3F2F4BDBEEADFC6BC39F	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

Right clasper extending dorsally into an arm abruptly elbowed at its middle and ventrally into an arm which is more roundly bent downward subbasally.</p> <p>Color pale, ochraceous, the eyes brown, the vertex fulvous, the tylus and juga reddish, the lora red and brown, the rostrum pale with black apex, antennae entirely pale, or the first segment slightly tinged with pink. Pronotum tinged with red anteriorly and distinctly brown laterally. Mesonotum and narrow basal portion of scutellum ochraceous, middle of scutellum broadly brown its apex nearly white. Hemelytra very distinctively marked, the clavi red on basal third, extending nearly to level of apex of scutellum, then abruptly ochraceous to apical fourth where they are again red to apices. Entire inner areas of coria red to slightly beyond level of apex of commissure of clavus, then broadly, transversely ochraceous to front margin of cuneus which is narrowly red laterally and broadly red medially. Middle of cuneus pale, its apex red at joining of red membranal veins and dark brown at tip. Costa! margin of corium entirely pale, the pale area broader than embolium except at level of apex of commissure of clavus. Membrane rather uniformly infuscated, with an ill-defined paler area across center. Under surface and legs entirely pale except for brown claws.</p> <p>Size: female, length 3.4 mm., width (hemelytra) 1.3 mm.; male, length 3.3 mm., width.(hemelytra) 1.2 mm.</p> <p>Holotype female, Yona, May 12, on Ficus, Usinger; allotype male, Mt. Alifan, May 26, on Pipturus, Usinger; one paratype, same data as holotype, and one same data as allotype; six paratypes, Piti, Aug. 13, 18, and 24, on Glochidion, and Sept. 12, on Pithecolobium, Swezey; two paratypes, Merizo, Oct. 2, on golden shower tree, Swezey; one paratype, Dededo, May 19, Usinger; two paratypes, Tarague, May 17, on Premna gaudichaudii, Usinger; one specimen, Mt. Alifan, April 20, Bryan.</p> <p>The paratypes show some color variation, there being reddish flecks around the eyes in some specimens, an occasional reddish tinge on the scutellum, and a suggestion of brown subapically on hind femora. The brown of the lateral margins, of pronotum extends over onto a portion of the propleura. The most distinctive feature of this species, other than the male genitalia, is the red central area of hemelytra with contrasting ochraceous across the middle of clavi. This is a common species on Guam and is obviously not host specific.</p> <p>A. signatus will run to flavus Knight or iniperatorius Distant in Knight's key (B. P. Bishop Mus., Bull. 142: 167, 1937) but does not agree with these or any other described species in color or in shape of male ge~ital claspers.</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F54B3F254BD7E764F946C8DD	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

The male genitalia are distinctive. Both signatus and bifasciatus have the frons convex and produced slightly between bases of antennae, a condition described by Knight in nigribasicornis and rubroclavus as "frons abrupt above base of tylus."</p> <p>Study of the type shows that Tichorhinus vitiensis Kirkaldy (Linn.

Tibiae with long black spines, most of which arise from black spots.</p> <p>Size: male, length ' 2.3 mm., width (hemelytra) 1 mm.; female, length 2.7 mm., width (hemelytra) 1.1 mm.</p> <p>Holotype male, allotype female, and two paratypes, Mt. Tenjo, May 3, on Scaevola koenigii, Usinger; five paratypes, Mt. Alifan, May 21, on milkweed, Usinger; one paratype, Inarajan, May 7, Usinger, and one, Piti, April 30, Usinger.</p> <p>The variation in color in this series is remarkable, one of the Mt. Alifan males having an entirely brown head except for the characteristic ochraceous base, entirely light brown scutellum, the clavus and corium brown except narrowly at base, and even the cuneus infuscated except basally and laterally. The under surfaces of thorax and abdomen are entirely brown, the hind femora are entirely brown except for pale bases and apices, thus nearly obscuring the slightly darker black spots, and the antennae are pale but vaguely infuscated. Other specimens from Alifan appear to be perfectly typical, so I assume that this represents an extreme form of color variation. In some specimens the rostrum scarcely exceeds the apices of middle coxae but the condition of the specimen determines whether the rostrum is fully extended or not. I know of no close relatives of this distinctive species.</p></div> 	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F5433F3D4BA0EC0EFBC0C3A3	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

Mesovelia orientalis Kirkaldy,</p> <p>Mus. Civ. Stor. Nat. Genova, Ann. II, 20: 808, 1901. (See figure 25, b.)</p> <p>Two specimens, Agana Swamp, May 2, Usinger; seven specimens, Agana Swamp, May 4, Usinger; all apterous. The May 2 specimens are darker in color than the others. These agree well with a specimen collected by me at Montalban, Luzon, Philippine Islands, July 14, 1936, and with two specimens before me from Garoet, Java, collected by Linsley. The middle femora have a row of short spines on the under side and the eighth abdominal segment in the male has a clump of short spines on the middle of the ventral surface and a clump of long hairs on either side. The second segment of the hind tarsi is longer than the third, the rostrum scarcely reaches to the level of the front margins of the hind coxae and the last two antenna! segments are subequal (or the last slightly longer) and less than twice as long as the second segment. The apical arm of the male clasper is shorter and broader basally and thus appears subtriangular, rather than long and tapering as figured by Lundblad (Arch. Hydrobiol. Suppl. 12: 187, 1933),.but the form of these claspers is known to vary within wide limits (Usinger, Brooklyn Ent. Soc., Bull. 37: 177-178, 1943) so a new species does not seem to be justified. The claspers are long and tapering and bent apically in both the Philippine and Javanese specimens, but slight variations in form are apparent. M. orientalis is known elsewhere from India and Ceylon through the East Indies to New Guinea, the Philippines, and Formosa. It was considered as a synonym of vittigera Horvath by Horvath in his monograph (Hist.-Nat. Mus. Nat. Hung., Ann. 13: 550, 1915) but was resurrected by the same author in 1924 (op. cit., 21: 35, 1924).</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F55D3F3F4BB5E92FFA73C338	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

M. hungerfordi Hale from Australia is larger and has "two elevated tufts of brownish-black spines on the venter of the first genital segment" (Hale, South Austr.

Esaki (Tenthredo 1:352, 1937) apparently overlooked this characteristic of diluta in his discussion of Microvelia notophora from the Carolines, for he stresses the "unique" habit of males habitually riding on the backs of the larger females and does not compare his new species with diluta. He reports the capture of a macropterous female of diluta at light on Saipan. Most of the Guam specimens were collected together, the small male clasped to the back of the female by means of his legs. None of these pairs was actually in copulation. M. notophora differs from diluta in that only the fore tibiae possess an apical comb and this comb is nearly one third the length of the tibia. Notophora differs further, according to Esaki's description, in the very short pronotum which is only about one third as long as the mesonotum. The size of apterous males and females of notophora is about as in diluta but the Guam males differ from this, being slightly larger, 1.4-1.5 mm. M. diluta Distant is known elsewhere from India, Ceylon, Sumatra, and Saipan.</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F55B3F3A4BC9EE13F8FEC485	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

Found near the rocky coral shore, usually within or around 3- or 4-foot coves or embayments. They occur singly or in threes and fours rather than in large numbers. Several pairs were captured in copulation.</p> <p>Esaki (Tenthredo 1: 355, 1937) records his New Guinean species bergrothi from the Carolines and from the coast of Rota Island, only a few miles away from Guam. It seems unlikely that two closely related but distinct species of marine insects, one of them presumably widespread, would occur so close together in the Marianas Islands, but my specimens do not agree with Esaki's original description of bergrothi (Hist.-Nat. Mus. Nat. Hung., Ann. 23: 161, figs. 12, c-e, 1926). H. bergrothi was captured "on the surface of a few cupfuls of rain-water, which was accumulated on a very thick root of a tree which laid about a half meter high from the earth in the half-dark shade of a dense wood", on Seleo, a coral island near New Guinea. I have seen a closely related species fromFiji.</p> <p>In Esaki's key (op. cit., p. 164) marianarum runs to papuensis but the head is much longer than broad between the eyes. It may be that the first dichotomy should read "Head nearly as long as broad across eyes." In any case, marianarum is closest to bergrothi, agreeing with that species in the subequal second and third antenna! segments and in the strongly convex mesonotum. Bergrothi differs, according to Esaki's description and figures, in the longer meso and metanota, front tarsus not shorter than half the length of tibia, first segment of middle tarsi one and one half times as long as second, and hind tarsus slightly longer than half the length of tibia. The male of bergrothi is longer and more slender (1.8 mm. by 0.8 mm.), and the female is considerably longer and slightly broader (2.7 mm. by 1.3 mm.).</p> <p>1Hale (South Austr. Mus., Rec. 3: 204, 1926) calls attention to the remarkable anterior tibial comb which occupies three sevenths of the length of the anterior tibia in maritima Bergroth. Although Esaki quotes Hale's work he ignored this important character in his description.</p> <p>I consider that the subfamily Haloveliinae Esaki belongs in. the Veliidae where Bergroth (Ent. Mo. Mag. II, 4: 277, 1893) originally placed it and whereHalealsoplacedit. Thelateralthoracicscentglandsofthe Veliidaeare distinct and functional (judging by small globules of hardened exudate at the openings in some specimens) in Halovelia, whereas gerrids have a single scentgland opening (omphalium) at the middle of the metasternum.</p> </div>	https://treatment.plazi.org/id/EC6DA359F55B3F344BC5E91CFA15C7E6	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

However, the front legs of the male differ in detail from those figured, the tarsi having a few short, stiff spines in a row on inner surface. These are not shown in Lundblad's figures of A. cleopatra. Also the combs at the bases of the front tibiae are nearly at right angles to the outer margins of the tibiae. Fijian specimens before me agree with Lundblad's figures in these respects but have a row of spines on the inner ridge which extends along tibia from the comb. The front femora and tibiae are slightly more robust in the Guam males.</p> <p>Differences in detail between Javan, Sumatran, New Caledonian, and Samoan specimens led Lundblad to consider this as a single variable species to be separated later, if the differences appeared to be constant, into several closely related species forming the "cleopatra-Gruppe."
