## Method 1: Using collectingDate, collectingDateMin, collectingDateMax

In this example, the sampling period is formatted using 3 attributes:
* collectingDate:2017-12-10
* collectingDateMin: 2017-12-10
* collectingDateMax: 2017-12-12

If we look at the verbatim version of the GBIF occurrence record (see below), we see that the **collectingDate** is stored as **eventDate**.

However, it appears that the **collectingDateMin** and **collectingDateMax** data are ignored.

Note that the evenDate field which is included in the DWCA is interpreted as '2007-12-10T00:00:00'
