My original male was headless; it may now be stated that the clypeus is nearly all yellow, but the yellow is strongly notched or bilobecl above; the band-like lateral face marks, about twice as broad below as above, extend along the inner orbits halfway up sides of front; labrum brown with a small yellowish mark; mandibles black with some reel sub-apically; scape yellow in front; flagellum dull ferruginous beneath. In one of the females, the face lacks the lateral marks.</p> </div>	http://treatment.plazi.org/id/026F1569FFD3FFF439229473FCE8F968	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

Megachile laticeps Smith,</p> <p>Cat. Hymenopt. British Mus. 1: 183, 1853.</p> <p>Ritidian Pt., April 16, Bryan; Agana, Aug. 13, Rowley; Barrigada, June, Swezey; Piti, May 12, July 7, 24, Sept. 16-20, Swezey, from trellised flowers of Antigonon leptopus, numerous males and females.</p> <p>The female is M. nietallescens Cockerell, which has been said to be identical with M. robbii Ashmead, though I did not think so when revising the Philippine Megachile. I now think that M. mcgregori Cockerell, based on the male, cannot be separated from M. laticeps. In the Philippine Journal of Science (16: 147, 1920), I wrote of M. 11icgregori: "This may be the male of Megachile 1netallescens, which occurs in the same two localities. The abdomen is not at all metallic; but otherwise, aside from the usual sexual differences, the insects are very much alike." This species has undoubtedly been introduced into Guam from the Philippine Islands.</p> <p>"This bee is widely distributed in Guam, but most of the specimens were collected at Piti. Evidence of its leafcutting activities was conspicuous throughout the island. Young kapok trees were often nearly completely defoliated by this bee, which cuts the circular and oblong bits of the leaves for the lining of nests. Rose bushes, too, were often nearly defoliated similarly."-O. H. Swezey.</p></div> 	http://treatment.plazi.org/id/026F1569FFD2FFF4398A9638FE49FE76	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

Halictus swezeyi Cockerell,</p> <p>B. P. Bishop Mus., 0cc. Papers 15 (5): 66 (in table only), 1939.</p> <p>Female, type. Similar to H. safjordi in many respects, but entirely distinct by the following characters: brassy green, with variable coppery or purple tints; area of metathorax short, boat shaped in outline (subtriangular in safjordi), with the hind margin straight or nearly so, and the whole surface covered with fine plicae which reach the margin and are connected by little lateral branches, forming a fine reticulation. The male of swezeyi is about 6 mm. long, considerably smaller and less robust than the male of saffordi, but very variable in coloration, and in the sculpture of the metathoracic area, which, however, is never of the sajfordi pattern. The tibiae are usually bright red, but in one specimen, which has a brilliant purple abdomen and black tegulae, the middle and hind tibiae are black. The apical plate is hardly half the width of that in male saffordi, and the wings are much clearer. Length, 7 to nearly 8 mm.</p> <p>Ritidian Pt., April 16, Bryan; Mt.

H. Timberlake, looking over Swezey's collection, had already recognized that this was a distinct species. Judging from the number of specimens, this would seem to be the commoner species.</p></div> 	http://treatment.plazi.org/id/026F1569FFD3FFF7392198CDFB65FB9B	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.
