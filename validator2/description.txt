9D0E87CA9C69FFD3FE1359CCF9C4F633.taxon	materials_examined	Holotype male, in the U. S. National Museum, allotype female in Bishop Museum, and 20 paratypes taken from fungus at Mata, Aug. 24, 1938, R. G. Oakley.	en	Zimmerman, Elwood C. (1942): Ciidae of Guam. In: Insects of Guam-I. Honolulu, Hawaii: Bernice P. Bishop Museum: 47-52, DOI: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5159455
9D0E87CA9C69FFD3FE1359CCF9C4F633.taxon	diagnosis	This species resembles Cis bisetosus Blair from the Marquesas, and Cis rapaae Zimmerman from Rapa in size and shape, but the color pattern and setae are very different on this species. Cis quadridentatus closely resembles Cis insignis Scott (1926) from the Seychelles, but it differs in color pattern as well as structure. The conspicuous bicolored dorsum with its distinct design will readily separate this pretty species from the two other Guam Cis.	en	Zimmerman, Elwood C. (1942): Ciidae of Guam. In: Insects of Guam-I.

9D0E87CA9C6AFFD1FE865906FAB2FDEC.taxon	materials_examined	Holotype female, in Bishop Museum, and six paratypes taken from a dead branch of breadfruit at Piti, Oct. 5, 1936, and two paratypes " ex dead small leaf ficus " at Yigo, Oct. 18, 1936. All the specimens were collected by Mr. Swezey.	en	Zimmerman, Elwood C. (1942): Ciidae of Guam. In: Insects of Guam-I. Honolulu, Hawaii: Bernice P.

9D0E87CA9C6AFFD1FE865906FAB2FDEC.taxon	diagnosis	This species somewhat resembles Cis collenettei Blair from southeastern Polynesia. It differs from that species in that it is smaller, narrower, more parallel-sided, has the sides of the prothorax straighter and the side margins more strongly developed, has more definite puncturation, and has the elytra clouded with yellow instead of being concolorous.	en	Zimmerman, Elwood C. (1942): Ciidae of Guam. In: Insects of Guam-I. Honolulu, Hawaii: Bernice P. Bishop Museum: 47-52, DOI: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5159455
9D0E87CA9C6BFFD6FE2B5E6EFB5CFB1D.taxon	materials_examined	Holotype male, in the U. S. National Museum, allotype female in Bishop Museum, one male and two female paratypes taken from tree fungus July 25, 1937, Oakley, no. 90.	en	Zimmerman, Elwood C. (1942): Ciidae of Guam. In: Insects of Guam-I. Honolulu, Hawaii: Bernice P. Bishop Museum: 47-52, DOI: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5159455
9D0E87CA9C6BFFD6FE2B5E6EFB5CFB1D.taxon	diagnosis	This species resembles Cis cheesmanae Blair from the Marquesas, but it is smaller, less robust, and distinctly less coarsely and conspicuously punctured.	en	Zimmerman, Elwood C. (1942): Ciidae of Guam. In: Insects of Guam-I. Honolulu, Hawaii: Bernice P. Bishop Museum: 47-52, DOI: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5159455
9D0E87CA9C6CFFD7FE835D2EF9ABF8BD.taxon	materials_examined	Holotype male, in the U. S. National Museum, allotype female in Bishop Museum, and 44 paratypes collected from a tree fungus, Aug. 25, 1937, Oakley (no. 90).	en	Zimmerman, Elwood C. (1942): Ciidae of Guam. In: Insects of Guam-I. Honolulu, Hawaii: Bernice P. Bishop Museum: 47-52, DOI: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5159455
9D0E87CA9C6CFFD7FE835D2EF9ABF8BD.taxon	diagnosis	The eight segmented antennae together with the serrate tibiae and the very narrowly separated fore coxae will readily separate this species from the other Guam Ciidae.	en	Zimmerman, Elwood C. (1942): Ciidae of Guam. In: Insects of Guam-I. Honolulu, Hawaii: Bernice P. Bishop Museum: 47-52, DOI: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5159455
