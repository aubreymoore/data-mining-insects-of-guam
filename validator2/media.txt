Cis quadridentatus, new species (figs. 1, c, e, i; pl. 1, A).</p> <p>Dermal coloration as follows: elytra basically pale yellow with a large black humeral spot, a prominent black spot at base between scutellum and humeral spot, and with a broad, conspicuous, black, zigzag fascia extending from middle at suture to side and there greatly expanded into a low, broad triangle that extends forward to base and posteriorly almost to apex, these black markings conspicuous; prothorax either almost or entirely dark or with a variable amount of yellow, sometimes entirely black, occasionally yellow with a broad, irregular dark vitta on either side; head usually dark, but occasionally with anterior parts yellowish; appendages usually brownish yellow; under surface brownish yellow and infuscated or fuscous; dorsal setae very dense, golden yellow or black, erect, stiff, coarse, spikelike on elytra, swirled on pronotum.</p> <p>Head not concealed from above by pronotum, crown almost straight in longitudinal contour in both sexes, but very slightly convex in female and slightly concave in male, densely setose, setae somewhat smaller than, but similar to, those on pronotum, and arising from small, closely placed punctures, surface appearing asperate; anterior margin slightly sinuous in the female but with four well-developed teeth in the male, the emarginations between teeth subequal. Antenna with the body of the first segment obliquely truncate at the apex, one fourth longer than broad, twice as long and twice as high as 2, 2 submoniliform, two thirds as long as 3, 3 slender, about three times as long as broad, as lortg as 4 plus 5, 4 longer than broad, as long as 5 plus half of 6, 5 to 7 successively slightly more transverse; club dark, as long as six preceding segments which are yellow, segments subequal in size and shape but 10 slightly longer and more pointed at apex, 8 and 9 about as broad as long. Prothorax slightly broader than long (1.9: 1.7), base slightly but distinctly sinuous, sides broadly arcuate, apex broadly rounded and but slightly emarginate at middle in female, but usually upturned and with a moderate or welldeveloped tooth on either side of middle in male; the lateral carina very narrowly visible from above, its basal angle rounded, thence slightly arcuate to apex and there extending beyond anterior margin, thus making anterior angle roundly acute rather than obtuse and making an emargination between lateral carina and apical margin when viewed from side; densely punctate, punctures small but coarse, distinct, narrowly separated. Elytra about five sevenths as broad as long, about twice or somewhat less than twice as long as prothorax, bullet-shaped, subparallel on sides in basal half, thence roundly narrowing to apex; densely and conspicuously punctate as pronotum; lateral carina broadly rounded into basal carina. Wings fully developed. Legs finely and sparsely setose, femora and tibiae finely alutaceous. Sternum finely setose, sculpture similar to but shallower and less distinct than that of dorsum; intercoxal process of the prosternum more than half as long as transverse diameter of a coxa (4: 7), mesocoxae hardly half so widely separated as fore coxae, metacoxae separated about as far as mesocoxae. Venter finely punctate, the setae conspicuous, moderately long, fine, hairlike; first ventrite simple in female, but with a small, median, setose, crater-like tubercle in male; intercoxal process narrowly triangular. Length, 2.5-2.75 mm.; breadth, 1.0- 1.25 mm.</p> <p>Holotype male, in the U. S. National Museum, allotype female in Bishop Museum, and 20 paratypes taken from fungus at Mata, Aug. 24, 1938, R. G. Oakley.</p> <p>This species resembles Cis bisetosus Blair from the Marquesas, and Cis rapaae Zimmerman from Rapa in size and shape, but the color pattern and setae are very different on this species. Cis quadridentatus closely resembles Cis insignis Scott (1926) from the Seychelles, but it differs in color pattern as well as structure. The conspicuous bicolored dorsum with its distinct design will readily separate this pretty species from the two other Guam Cis.</p> </div>	http://treatment.plazi.org/id/9D0E87CA9C69FFD3FE1359CCF9C4F633	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

Cis guamae, new species (fig. 1 d; pl. 1, B).</p> <p>Dermal coloration in mature specimens as follows: dorsum quite shiny; elytra black, with a variable, oblique yellowish cloud at basal third which is sometimes small and isolated from suture, or large and reaching from suture to side, with a larger, similarly colored macula usually occupying most of caudal third; pronotum black with apex yellowish; head black; antennae yellow, clubs infuscate; legs yellow or brownish yellow; lower surface fuscous to black; dorsal setae pale.</p> <p>Head not concealed from above by pronotum; distinctly convex dorsally and laterally in both sexes, finely alutaceous, shiny, finely and densely punctate, punctures separated by about breadth of their diameters, each puncture bearing a minute seta that projects but slightly from puncture; fore legs with only slightly developed flanges on either side in both sexes, not at all distinctly toothed. Antennae with body of first segment about twice as long as broad, about twice as long as 2, 2 about one fourth longer than broad or as broad as long, two thirds as long as 3, 3 almost three times as long as broad, as long as 4 plus 5, 4 almost as long as 5 plus 6, 5 to 7 successively shorter and more transverse; club with segment 11 about three fourths to fully as long as 9 plus 10, 9 and 10 each broader than long. Prothorax distinctly broader than long (3.7: 3), base slightly sinuous, appearing distinctly angulate at hind corners above, but slightly arcuate on sides from baseÂ· to apex, lateral carinae broadly exposed throughout their lengths from above, apex broadly rounded, not upturned, nor toothed, nor otherwise modified in either sex; lateral carina slightly arcuate, hind angles obviously angulate, obtuse, but forming only slightly more than right angles, fore corners visible from above, distinctly angulate, rather similar to hind angles; dorsum shiny, densely, finely, distinctly punctate, punctures separated by interstices equal to or narrower than their diameters and bearing flecklike setae that project but slightly beyond sides of punctures. Elytra two thirds as broad as long, twice as long as prothorax, very slightly arcuate on sides, almost parallel in basal two thirds, thence broadly rounded to apex; lateral margin visible throughout its length from above, angulately rounded at base; dorsum shiny, puncturation dense throughout and similar to that of pronotum; setae speck-like, hardly protruding from punctures. Wings fully developed. Legs with femora and tibiae finely reticulate, finely and sparsely setose. Stermmi coarsely reticulate, evidently at most obscurely punctate; intercoxal process of prosternum slightly more than one half as broad as transverse chord of a coxa (4: 7), broadly convex transversely, not carinate and slightly but conspicuously protruding forward beyond apex of prosternum, thus making anterior margin of prosternum concave on either side of middle; mesocoxae separated by only about half as far as fore coxae; metacoxae somewhat more widely separated than mesocoxae; metasternum as long along median line as ventrite 1 plus half of 2. Venter obscurely punctate, reticulate, finely se'tose; ventrite 1 evidently not modified in male. Length, 1.75-2.3 mm.; breadth, 0.75- 0.1 mm.</p> <p>Holotype female, in Bishop Museum, and six paratypes taken from a dead branch of breadfruit at Piti, Oct. 5, 1936, and two paratypes "ex dead small leaf ficus" at Yigo, Oct. 18, 1936. All the specimens were collected by Mr. Swezey.</p> <p>I could find no external differences on a specimen I assume to be a male to separate it from the females other than the fact that the first ventrite seemed to have some longer setae toward the middle. None of the specimens have a trace of a median tubercle on the first ventrite.</p> <p>To the unaided eyes, most of the specimens appear quite black, but some of them are obscurely or distinctly bicolored.</p> <p>This species somewhat resembles Cis collenettei Blair from southeastern Polynesia. It differs from that species in that it is smaller, narrower, more parallel-sided, has the sides of the prothorax straighter and the side margins more strongly developed, has more definite puncturation, and has the elytra clouded with yellow instead of being concolorous.</p> </div>	http://treatment.plazi.org/id/9D0E87CA9C6AFFD1FE865906FAB2FDEC	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.

Antennae with body of first segment ovate, about two thirds as broad as long, almost as long as 2 plus 3, 2 slightly longer than 3, submoniliform, broader at base, 3 and 4 elongate, subequal, together as long as 5 to 7 which are very small and successively more transverse; club slightly longer than five preceding segments, 9 and 10 subequal in size and shape. Prothora.r broader than long (2.2: 1.7), base subtruncate, broadly arcuate on sides, broadly convex apically, fore margin simple and unmodified in either sex; lateral carina and its fore and hind angles visible throughout its length from above, hind corners strongly and conspicuously rounded, not at all angulate, thence continued in a broad curve and rounded into apical margin; dorsum shiny, densely, microscopically, evenly punctate throughout, punctures separated by interstices equal to or somewhat broader than their diameters; the setae not or hardly discernible even under high magnification. Elytra shiny, two thirds as broad as long, about two and one third times as long as prothorax, slightly arcuate in basal two thirds, thence convexly narrowed to the apex; the lateral carina broadly rounded into basal carina; sculpture consisting of dense, irregular, shallow, variable punctures distinctly larger than those on pronotum, evidently appearing to be somewhat confluent in some places, interspersed with minute punctures similar to those on pronotum; setae microscopic. Wings fully developed. Legs with femora and tibiae finely and sparsely setose. Sternmn rather coarsely reticulate, at most shallowly and indistinctly punctate; intercoxal process of prosternum about half as broad as transverse chord of a coxa, V-shaped in cross section in front of coxae and only slightly interrupting apical margin of prosternum; mesocoxae about half as widely separated as fore coxae; metacoxae about as broadly separated as mesocoxae; metasternum as long along median line as ventrite 1 plus half of 2.

However, C. cacuminmn is shiny black, it evidently lacks the median pit on the first ventrite of the male, the metasternum and venter are evidently definitely punctate, and from the nature of its habitat there are good reasons for believing that it is an endemic product of the highlands of the Seychelles.</p> </div>	http://treatment.plazi.org/id/9D0E87CA9C6BFFD6FE2B5E6EFB5CFB1D	Public Domain	No known copyright restrictions apply.
